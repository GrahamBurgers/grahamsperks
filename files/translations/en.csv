Why or how or when, it is all unknown.\nPerhaps these gifts, and their associated magicks, can be rediscovered somehow.\nTributes to the gods, in the form of feats to accomplish...

And what an end they eventually came to because of it.\nAs a child, they often were praised and rewarded for their perseverance.\nAs an adult, they were scolded and dismissed for their stubbornness.\nTwo words for the same phenomenon, I suppose.\nSomehow, they got stuck on the idea of being 'crowned' by their god.\nA divine way to show that Robin was truly the best, the strongest, the smartest.\nOf course... they weren't any of those things. Not even close. I think Robin knew it too.",,,,,,,,,,,,
graham_book_corrupt_02,"Somehow, I ended up becoming friends with them at a young age.\nThey were more talented than me at almost everything, to my disgruntlement.\nShockingly, our friendship persevered for several years after we had left school,\nuntil it eventually broke apart... no thanks to Robin's own stubborn nature.\nI kept hearing stories of Robin and their awful arrogant schemes, but I still held some respect for them.\nIt seems so stupid now... the petty little things that I cared about back then.",,,,,,,,,,,,
graham_book_corrupt_03,"One day, Robin suddenly went missing. A week went by... I convinced myself that it was some sort of publicity stunt.\nI went to their house to visit them, to scold them. 'They must just be laying low for a while, to make people curious,' I thought.\nI assumed they would pop out after a month or two, tell some grand tale about where they were, and be the town favourite again.\nBut they never came back. I went to their home, but the only thing that remained was a pile of smoldering ashes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was as if they had never existed at all. Except for, of course, those in the village who mourned.\nEvery day they cried, talked about Robin, prayed to the Gods for support.\nI became even more isolated.\nNothing seemed to make sense anymore. This person, this friend that I had long since abandoned...\nWhy were they still influencing me so much, even now?",,,,,,,,,,,,
graham_book_corrupt_05,"In our youth, Robin and I had traveled often throughout our village and the land surrounding it.\nBut there was one place that we never had ventured.\nA cave entrance, boarded up and plastered with warning signs about dangerous monsters.\nLost in scattered thoughts, I traveled there, to the spot where we had sat outside and fantasized for hours about what could lie inside.\nExcept this time, the boards were gone. Ripped off and thrown to the ground, alongside a lighter and a small notebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,
graham_book_corrupt_06,"The notebook's pages were both charred and wet - it had rained shortly after Robin burned it, I suppose.\nThe text was completely incomprehensible, but I recognized their handwriting.\nI sighed, took out my travel backpack, and sat down in a clearing nearby.\nWhen nightfall came, I lit a campfire and ate from my bag, keeping one eye on the cave entrance at all times.\nRobin was still in there. And I was not going to leave until they came back out.",,,,,,,,,,,,
graham_book_corrupt_07,"And so I waited, for what seemed like weeks. One day, as my food was running low, they emerged.\nBloody and bruised, they dragged behind them the corpse of a giant spider.\nThey looked horribly thin - evidently, there wasn't much food in that cave to begin with.\nThe most surprising thing: they didn't seem to notice me at all.\nThey kept their head low as they slowly trudged past, dragging the body behind them.\nDown the road they traveled, towards our humble little town.\nWhat the hell were they doing?",,,,,,,,,,,,
graham_book_corrupt_08,"They spoke to themselves loudly as they walked. They seemed to be on the verge of insanity - which didn't quite surprise me.\nThey were finally going to be worthy, loved by all, crowned...\nIt was sickening to see. They had left so much behind.\nI followed them to the middle of the town. People watched in horror... some cried out.\n'Was that Robin?! Back after all this time?!'\nThey kept going, further, further... to the altar in the middle of the town.\nThey laid down the corpse on the altar, dropped to their knees, and looked to the sky in prayer.",,,,,,,,,,,,
