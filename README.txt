Hello there, seeker of true knowledge.
What do you search for in here? Certainly there's nothing I would hide from you in here, hmm?
Don't poke around where you shouldn't, or...
You may discover something far more sinister than the Hunger hiding in these files... Heehee~!

---ACTUAL DEV NOTES BELOW---

Heya! If you're poking through the files here, you might find references to unimplemented Immunity Aura and Materialist perks.
I definitely want to implement these both one day, but I'm afraid I don't have the technical knowledge as of now.
Perhaps someone curious, who likes looking through the code of mods, could help with that goal, hm?
...Or perhaps not. It's not a big deal, after all - just some ideas that stuck with me and that I would like to eventually bring to life.
That being said, however, I sincerely hope you enjoy the mod! It's been a lot of fun working on it, and I hope to add more in the future!

This is gonna sound like some middle-of-the-night insane ramblings here, but hear me out.
status_bloody in the translation files is "Bloody ". Which makes sense if they're trying to space it out from the percentages.
But ONLY oiled and bloody have that extra space. Everything else is just "Alcoholic", "Slimy", "Wet", etc.
WHY, NOLLA?! Why do I need to fit more obscure knowledge into my head?! I am legitimately dispairing over this.
No other game has made me feel both so knowledgeable and still like I'm at the base of a huge mountain of unknowables.
Is this on purpose? It certainly seems like it would be hard to do by accident, but it doesn't make sense for it to be on purpose.
...Anyway, check out The Unfolded Eye by From Grotto (the amazing people who also made Noita's soundtrack). It's super good.

I've been wanting to add unlockable perks for a bit, but a few reasons have prevented me from doing so:
- I don't want to gate any already-existing perks behind unlocks, so I'd have to make a brand-new perk in order to make it unlockable
- If the unlock methods are too hard or unnecessarily inconvenient, less people will want to go out of their way to unlock it, meaning I essentially
  spent the same amount of time making a perk for less people that'll actually play with it
But... the Hunger calls to me, and the Demise perk was already being worked on in the background while I decided if it fit into the mod or not.
Perhaps I'll use unlockable perks as a sort of way for those who are dedicated to access the perks that are on-the-fence.
That being said, I hope you enjoy it! I'd love to hear your feedback on the idea of unlockable perks.
(Also, I'm enjoying writing the character of Robin way too much so far... More to come in the future, I suppose.)

Oh, I forgot to edit 1.3's message to reflect the fact that Materialist is now in the game. Well, I suppose I won't do it now.
Hm, what else do I put here...? Ah, someone had the idea to turn the Blunt Wand into a questline where you had to repair it; I like this idea quite a bit.
Perhaps, I could tie it in to the long-forgotten Melody and Symphony materials that were present in the earliest version of this mod.
After all, magical music does have quite a bit of potential...

This update isn't very important. I just thought it was way too funny to allow Lucky Day to work on enemies.

Welp, that's it! Hey, Immunity Aura is here too! 11 new perks! Heck yeah! I'm quite excited about this update, as you probably could guess.
I could write paragraphs about all the little things that I put into this mod... but I'll hold off for now.
Hope you enjoy it!
(Come to think of it, have I been hyping this up too much...? I mean... it's not *that* much content...
...Well, the mod was meant to be Vanilla+ all along, so whatever.)

Thanks to the community members that suggested some of these fixes to me! I enjoy recieving all constructive feedback.
Never be afraid to tell me something you think I need to hear, even if you think it'll hurt my feelings. It's for the best for all of us.
...Hey, Noita's been getting some patches lately, huh? That's... really, really cool.
I feel like my brain is rate-limiting the amount of excitement that I'm experiencing, but rest assured, I am incredibly excited about it.
And I will NEVER have to explain to someone why the Chainsaw is lagging their game ever again. Hell yeah.
